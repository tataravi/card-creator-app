## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or cloud)
- npm or yarn
- Docker (for MongoDB container)

### 🐳 Docker Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# Start MongoDB with Docker
docker run -d --name mongodb -p 27017:27017 mongo:latest
```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mindnode-card-app.git
   cd mindnode-card-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install root dependencies
   npm install
   
   # Install backend dependencies
   cd server && npm install
   
   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd ../client && npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Setup**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory:
   ```env
   PORT=5001
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/card-app
   JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here-make-this-secure-in-production
   NODE_ENV=development
   CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

4. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   # From the root directory
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   This will start both the backend server (port 5001) and frontend (port 3000).

### Alternative Setup

You can also run the servers separately:

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd client
npm start
```
