## 📁 **Your MindNode Files**
The app is specifically optimized for your leadership content:
- **Manual of me.mindnode**
- **Master Prioritization.mindnode** 
- **Managing Processes.mindnode**
- **Managing People.mindnode**

You can upload these files and the app will create interactive cards from your leadership and management content.

## 🔧 **Technical Details:**

### **Database:**
- MongoDB running in Docker container
- Container name: `mongodb`
- Port: 27017
- Database: `card-app`

### **Backend:**
- Node.js with Express
- Port: 5001 (changed from 5000 due to AirPlay conflict)
- JWT authentication
- File upload processing
- Content analysis and card generation

### **Frontend:**
- React 18 with modern hooks
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Redux for state management
- Responsive design with dark mode

## 🛠 **Management Commands:**

### **Start the Application:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

### **Stop the Application:**
```bash
pkill -f "npm run dev"
```

### **MongoDB Commands:**
```bash
# View MongoDB container
docker ps

# Stop MongoDB
docker stop mongodb

# Start MongoDB
docker start mongodb

# Remove MongoDB container
docker rm mongodb
```

### **View Logs:**
```bash
# Backend logs
cd server && npm run dev

# Frontend logs  
cd client && npm start
```

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**
1. **Upload your MindNode files** to see the card generation in action
2. **Explore the features** - try creating collections and rating cards
3. **Customize the app** - modify card types, categories, or styling
4. **Share with others** - the app supports user registration and sharing

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting:**
- If the app doesn't load, check that both servers are running
- If MongoDB fails, restart the Docker container: `docker restart mongodb`
- If you get port conflicts, the app will automatically use alternative ports

**Your card creation app is now fully operational! 🎉**
